abstract: |
  This work aims to integrate human-centered insights with data-driven approaches. To do so, it starts by studying the drivers’ views on the operation, considering different contexts: urban and inter-urban networks on high and low density areas. 
key-points:
  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis
  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.
